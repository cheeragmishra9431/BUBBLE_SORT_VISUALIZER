. In this project, we will visualize Bubble Sort using JavaScript. We will see how the elements are swapped in Bubble Sort and how we get the final sorted array. We will also visualize the time complexity of Bubble Sort. 
 Approach:

1.First, we will generate a random array using Math.random() function.
2.Different colors are used to indicate which elements are being compared, sorted, and unsorted.
3.Since the algorithm performs the operation very fast, the setTimeout() function has been used to slow down the process.
4.New array can be generated by pressing the “Ctrl+R” key.
5.The sorting is performed using BubbleSort() function using swap() function
